# Frontend Design

## Purpose

This document defines the frontend structure and user interface design of AdAdd.

The frontend provides interfaces for sponsorship management based on user roles and business responsibilities.

The frontend design follows these principles:

* Display information according to user responsibilities.
* Do not expose unauthorized operations.
* Reflect business workflows rather than database structures.
* Keep complex sponsorship operations understandable for committee members.

# UI Design Principles

## Principle 1: Show Required Information Only

Users should not see unnecessary information.

Example:

Finance users do not need sales communication details.

---

## Principle 2: Use Workflow-Based UI

Avoid displaying raw database entities.

Example:

Instead of:

```text
ContractMenu.status = WAITING
```

Display:

```text
広告データ提出待ち
```

---

## Principle 3: Preserve History

Important actions should be visible through timelines.

Examples:

* Progress changes
* Assignment changes
* Payment updates

---

# Future Extensions

Potential improvements:

* Mobile-friendly sponsorship member interface
* Notification system
* Analytics dashboard
* Calendar integration
