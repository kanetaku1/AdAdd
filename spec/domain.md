# Domain Model

## Purpose

This document defines the business domain of AdAdd.

The domain model represents business concepts rather than database tables or API resources.

All implementations should follow this model.

# Domain Overview

The sponsorship business is centered around the **Yearly Company**.

A Company exists independently of festival years.

Each festival year creates a Yearly Company that represents the relationship between the festival and that company for a specific year.

Everything else belongs to the Yearly Company.

A Sponsorship Menu is the yearly master definition of what can be sponsored (e.g. Pamphlet advertisement, Homepage banner advertisement, Company booth). A Contract Menu is the concrete instance a company actually contracted for, carrying its own progress, assignee, and Drive folder. A Contract Menu may be a goods-sponsorship return (`isGoodsSponsorship`) rather than a paid item — see Contract Menu → Goods Sponsorship below.

# Aggregates

## Year

Represents one festival cycle.

### Responsibilities

* Manage festival years
* Archive yearly data
* Separate yearly business information

### Relationships

```
Year
 ├── YearlyCompany (0..*)
 └── SponsorshipMenu (0..*)
```

---

## Sponsorship Menu

Represents one type of sponsorship benefit offered during a festival year.

This is master data. It defines what can be sponsored, not what a specific company sponsored.

### Responsibilities

* Name
* Default price
* Whether submission/production is required
* Whether the menu is currently offered

### Relationships

```
Year
 └── SponsorshipMenu (0..*)
      └── ContractMenu (0..*)
```

---

## Company

Represents a company.

A Company is permanent.

It does not belong to a specific festival year.

### Responsibilities

* Company profile
* Contact information
* Company history

### Relationships

```
Company
 └── YearlyCompany (0..*)
```

---

## Yearly Company (Aggregate Root)

This is the core aggregate of AdAdd.

It represents a company's sponsorship activity during one festival year.

Every business process starts from a Yearly Company.

### Responsibilities

* Sponsorship progress
* Assigned members
* Company status (continuing / new / dormant)
* Sponsorship phase (outreach priority ranking for the current Year)
* Activity history
* Sponsorship contracts

Advisors are not assigned to a Yearly Company directly. An Advisor supervises Sponsorship Members, and monitors company progress indirectly through the members assigned to that company.

### Relationships

```
YearlyCompany

├── Year
├── Company
├── Assignment
├── SponsorshipContract
└── ActivityLog
```

---

## Sponsorship Contract

Represents one sponsorship agreement.

A Yearly Company has at most one contract (zero before it is created). A single company/organization is invoiced and receipted once per Year, even though the contract may bundle multiple Sponsorship Menus (via multiple Contract Menus).

### Responsibilities

* Contract information
* Sponsorship contents (Contract Menus)

### Relationships

```
YearlyCompany
      │
      └── SponsorshipContract
```

---

## Contract Menu

Represents one Sponsorship Menu that a company has actually contracted for, as part of a Sponsorship Contract.

A Contract Menu references exactly one Sponsorship Menu. A contract may contain multiple Contract Menus.

The management content differs depending on the referenced Sponsorship Menu's `requiresSubmission`: submission/production management when true (e.g. print advertisements, web-based formats such as a homepage banner), or none when false (e.g. company booth — booth logistics only).

### Goods Sponsorship (物品協賛)

A company may sponsor with goods/items instead of money. The festival provides advertising in exchange, equivalent to the value of the goods received.

Goods sponsorship is **not** a Sponsorship Menu of its own — the same Sponsorship Menu (e.g. a Pamphlet ad) is contracted normally in some contracts and given as a goods-sponsorship return in others, so the distinction cannot live on the menu. It is a property of the individual Contract Menu:

* `ContractMenu.isGoodsSponsorship` (boolean) marks that this specific line is provided free of charge as a return for goods received, rather than a paid item. When true, `unitPrice` is conventionally `0`.
* The goods description and estimated value are recorded in `SponsorshipContract.remarks` (free text, contract-wide — not per Contract Menu) — this content is always entered manually, never imported from Google Forms (see `spec/usecase.md` UC-06).
* A contract may mix ordinary paid Contract Menus and `isGoodsSponsorship` ones; `SponsorshipContract.totalAmount` still sums `quantity * unitPrice` across all of them, so goods-sponsorship-only contracts correctly total ¥0.

### Responsibilities

* Quantity and unit price
* Production method (when submission is required)
* Progress status
* Google Drive folder

### Relationships

## Payment

Represents payment information for a contract.

### Responsibilities

* Amount
* Payment status
* Confirmation (date and performer of the Finance Department's manual confirmation — see `spec/model.md#Payment`, `confirmedAt`/`confirmedById`)

### Relationships

```
SponsorshipContract
        │
        └── Payment
```

---

## Activity Log

Represents business history.

Every important action should generate an Activity Log.

History should never be modified.

### Examples

* Member assigned
* Materials sent
* Contract confirmed
* Payment confirmed

---

# Supporting Entities

## User

Represents a system user.

A user may have multiple roles.

---

## Role

Represents permissions.

Examples include:

* Sponsorship Member
* Advisor
* Finance Department
* Sponsorship Menu Management

---

## Advisor Assignment

Represents the supervision relationship between a Sponsorship Advisor and a Sponsorship Member.

An Advisor is assigned to Members, not to Yearly Companies or Companies.

### Responsibilities

* Link an Advisor to a Sponsorship Member
* Scope the assignment to a festival Year

### Relationships

```
User (Advisor)
      │
      └── AdvisorAssignment
                │
                └── User (Sponsorship Member)
```

# Value Objects

The following concepts are immutable values.

## Company Status

Represents the company's relationship history with the festival. Informed by past Company/YearlyCompany data.

Examples:

* Continuing
* New
* Dormant

When a Yearly Company is generated (UC-01, both the bulk per-Year generation and individual mid-cycle registration), `companyStatus` is computed automatically:

* **Continuing** — the Company had a Yearly Company in the immediately preceding Year, and a Sponsorship Contract was created for it.
* **New** — every other case, including a company that was contacted in a previous Year but never reached a contract.

**Dormant is never auto-assigned at generation.** It is only ever set by a manual reclassification during UC-02 (e.g. the company could not be reached, or has gone out of business) — see the existing inline-editable `companyStatus` on the Yearly Company List (`spec/frontend.md`).

---

## Sponsorship Phase

Represents the outreach priority ranking assigned to a Yearly Company by the Company Management Team during the Year preparation period (see UC-02). Independent of Company Status — a Continuing company and a New company can both be assigned any Sponsorship Phase.

Examples:

* Phase 1 (highest priority)
* Phase 2
* Phase 3

---

## Sponsorship Progress

Typical values:

* Not Contacted
* Materials Sent
* Sponsorship Confirmed
* Invoice Sent
* Payment Received
* Receipt Sent
* Declined
* Pending

---

## Contract Menu Production Type

Applies only when the referenced Sponsorship Menu requires submission. The company chooses between these when submitting the Google Forms application, and the choice determines what the company submits — a finished product, or raw material for the committee to build from.

* Company Production — the company submits a finished, ready-to-use product (完成品).
* Internal Production — the company submits raw material (素材, e.g. logo, text/copy), and the Sponsorship Menu Management Team has another department produce the finished product from it.

---

## Contract Menu Status

* Waiting
* Requested
* Producing
* Completed
* Submitted

---

## Payment Status

Examples:

* Waiting
* Confirmed

```

The Advisor–Member relationship is independent of the YearlyCompany aggregate. A Yearly Company never references an Advisor directly.

# Lifecycle

## Company

```
Create

↓

Update

↓

Reuse every year
```

Companies are never recreated every year.

---

## Yearly Company

```
Create Year

↓

Assign Members

↓

Manage Sponsorship

↓

Archive
```

A new Yearly Company is created every festival year.

---

## Sponsorship Contract

A Sponsorship Contract is created only once an agreement is actually reached — there is no separate draft state to track on the contract itself. A contract may be created directly when an agreement is made outside Google Forms.

Overall progress toward completing the engagement (materials sent, invoice sent, payment received, receipt sent) is tracked on `YearlyCompany.progress`, not as a separate lifecycle on the contract.

---

## Contract Menu

```
Waiting

↓

Requested

↓

Producing

↓

Completed

↓

Submitted
```

For menus that do not require submission (e.g. company booth), the lifecycle may skip directly from Waiting to Completed.

A homepage banner requires submission (`requiresSubmission = true`) — the company provides banner artwork/logo data — and follows the full submission lifecycle, the same as a print advertisement.

---

## Payment

```
Waiting

↓

Confirmed
```

Confirmation is performed manually by the Finance Department.

# Domain Principles

The Yearly Company is the center of the domain.

Business logic should be implemented around business concepts rather than database tables.

The domain model should remain stable even if the database schema or frontend implementation changes.
